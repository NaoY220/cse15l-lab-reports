Instruction
--------

1. Setup Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account. See this Github link on how to delete forks.
2. Setup Fork the repository
3. The real deal Start the timer!
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!) 

For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9),

1. Take a screenshot
2. Write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step, including <enter> and <space> (e.g., cd<space>L<tab><enter> or <down><down><down><down><down><down><down><enter>). For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting.
3. Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.

For example, when you run the tests, you might want to use the up arrow or Ctrl-R to access your bash history rather than typing in the full command with classpath, etc. You might say something like this accompanying the screenshot for running the tests:

    Keys pressed: <up><up><up><up><enter>, <up><up><up><up><enter> The javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java command was 4 up in the search history, so I used up arrow to access it. Then the java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ... command was 4 up in the history, so I accessed and ran it in the same way.

Add this lab report to your Github Pages site, and submit a PDF of it as usual.
