Part 1 - Bugs
--------

Choose one of the bugs from week 4's lab.

Provide:

1. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown).
2. An input that doesn't induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown).
3. The symptom, as the output of running the two tests above (provide it as a screenshot -- one test should pass, one test should fail).
4. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown).
5. Briefly describe (2-3 sentences) why the fix addresses the issue.
